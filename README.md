`HangMan Game`

Welcome to the Hangman Game repository! This repository contains the C++ code for a console-based hangman game.

This README provides an overview of a Hangman game implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The game allows players to guess a word by providing letters and has a limited number of attempts before losing.

The game works by selecting a word from a pre-defined list and displaying the number of letters in the word as underscores. The user can guess letters one at a time, and if the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the word. If the letter is not in the word, the user will lose a life. The game ends when the user guesses the word or runs out of lives.

To get started with the game, you can clone this repository onto your local machine and compile the source code using a C++ compiler. Once the game is compiled, you can run it and start playing.

`The repository is organized into several files, including:`

`hangman.cpp:` This file contains the main code for the game.

`words.txt:` This file contains the list of words used in the game.

If you would like to add more words to the game, you can modify the words.txt file and add your own words.

The game is designed to be simple and easy to understand, but you can modify the code to suit your needs. If you encounter any issues or have any questions about the game code, feel free to create a new issue in the repository.

Thank you for using the Hangman Game repository.
